          <p style="font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">
            I was one of five developers that worked on a different version of Reddit called Saidit made with Python and Django and styled with Bootstrap.
            When we came together as a group we had decided reddit was considered, " too complicated",
            so we made it more simple but with its similar great functionalities. Throughout the Project
            I worked on the models for the user and posts. I also worked on implementing Bootstrap for the styling. I worked on most of the styling for the forms pages and the Home page, and also on some functionality troughout the project.

          <p style="font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">
            This was an individual project I had made for Kenzie Academy. The name of the project is called Todo App.
            This app was made with react, HTML, and CSS. This project was primarly based on learning how to set up a functioning app with mulitple pages and with a few different functionalities.
            Compared to many assignments in the quarter, this was probably one of the most chalenging assignments I had to do. It was  great learning experience, not just for me but for my comfort in React and the use of more than one page as well.

          <p style="font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">
            This was an Individual Project that I had worked on my free time. Its my portfolio like this one exept it uses Javascript, Three.js, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
            This project itself took longer than it would usually take me to finish one. That's because i had not ever worked with three.js and I decided to take the chalange and give it a try.
            with The help of three.js and javascript I was able to make not only a great looking portfolio but a 3D Portfolio!
            The project itself took a month, because there many errors that i have not handled before but while working troughout the project I started to get what the errors were and I succeded!

          <p style="font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">
            I was One of Three developers that worked on this project. The project is called Tower Of Hanoi. this project was done using javascript, HTML, and CSS.
            This was the first group project that I had worked on as a developer but it was the same way for the rest of the team.
            Since thus was our frist group project we decided to do it a different way. we decided one person was going to code while the other 2 people would be telling the typer what to code or helping with bugs. 
            I worked on all parts of the project, just like my other two team members. We had the app up and running after less than 3 days of work so we decided to add more styling and making it our own way.
